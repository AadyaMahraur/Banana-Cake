Peel and chop the bananas. Add them to a bowl and mash them with a fork. You can also use a blender to mash the bananas.
Add sugar, oil and vanilla extract.
Mix thoroughly so that the oil mixes evenly with the banana puree and the sugar dissolves.
Sieve whole wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt directly in the bowl. You can also sieve these separately and then add them to the wet ingredients.
Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients very well.
Add the chopped walnuts and fold again. Apart from walnuts, you can also add raisins, pistachios or any nuts and dry fruits of your choice.
Pour the batter in a greased or lined loaf pan ( 7.5 x 4 x 2.5 inches) or round cake pan (7.5 x 2 inches).
